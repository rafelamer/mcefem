When I wrote this code, I was interested in differents topics about C programming:
    1. How to read XML files
    2. How to use different linear solvers
    3. How to embed Lua and Python interpreters
    
Then, there are lots of Linux packages needed to compile this library and programs



In the folder mcefem

$ make
$ sudo make install

and the shared library is installed in /usr/local/lib and include files in
/usr/local/include/mce
